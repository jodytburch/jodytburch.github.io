               Thanks for checking out my GitHub page.  I am new to this fun world of front-end web programming, however I do have over 20 years of experience working in Information Technology. <br>
               I started my career as a software developer mostly coding in C/C++, then transitioned into high level design of solutions, and overseeing delivery of projects.  The majority of my career has been in the Financial Industry and spread across the following two areas: <br>
               IVR (Interactive Voice Response) Application Delivery <br>
               Enterprise-Wide API Interface Design and Governance<br>
              <br>
              After being away from hands-on development for many years, I realized that I missed that sense of accomplishment and satisfaction when you code something and then see it working!  So, I decided to enroll in the course "Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN" from <a href="https://xpro.mit.edu/">MIT xPro</a> to learn how developers make things happens with the tools available today. It has been a fun and challenging experience so far!
